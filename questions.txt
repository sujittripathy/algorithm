# Find the 3rd to last element in a LinkedList. (E)
# In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values: (E)
the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.

Notes : Needs to solve by BFS approach with queue
# Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/
Notes: This is a backtracking problem where each char needs to be iterated with nested loop , and once exhaused then outer loop will continue. Approach is to take an aux buffer array to puts items.

Count Inversions in an array
Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.
Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j
Example:
The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

# You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
Find the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes). (E)

# Coin Change Problem: Given a set of coin denominations, print out the different ways you can make a target amount. You can use as many coins of each denomination as you like.
For example: If coins are [1,2,5] and the target is 5, output will be:
[1,1,1,1,1]
[1,1,1,2]
[1,2,2]
[5]

# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?
